# registration
This project is a User Registration System developed using Java, Servlets, JDBC, and MySQL. It allows users to register by entering username, email, and password, which are then stored securely in a MySQL database. The project follows a layered architecture (Model–DAO–Servlet) to maintain clean separation of concerns.
